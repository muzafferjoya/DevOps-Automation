# Ansible Automation Scripts for Infrastructure Management

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Ansible automation scripts designed to streamline infrastructure management tasks. These playbooks automate essential processes such as server provisioning, user management, firewall configuration, system updates, and monitoring setup, ensuring a reliable and secure infrastructure.

## Features

1. **Server Provisioning**: Automates the installation of essential packages on new servers.

      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install essential packages
      apt:
        name:
          - vim
          - curl
          - git
        state: present 
```

2. **User Management**: Creates user accounts and configures SSH access securely.

  hosts: all
  vars:
    users:
      - username: "devopsuser"

        ssh_key: "ssh-rsa XXXXXXXXX..."

  tasks:
    - name: Create users
      user:
        name: "{{ item.username }}"
        state: present
      loop: "{{ users }}"
